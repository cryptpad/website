    <p>Anyone is free to use or modify the code we've written, but we have the knowledge and expertise to do so without compromizing the integrity of its privacy-preserving features. <a href="consulting.html">Sponsoring our team</a> to make the improvements you require ensures that we'll incorporate your needs into the core platform's assumptions so that it doesn't break the next time you update.</p>

<div class="half" id="contributing">
    <p>If you use CryptPad then you are already benefitting from others' contributions to the project. Improvements that are funded as part of our <a href="consulting.html">consulting packages and custom development</a> are often integrated into the open-source project. Sponsored development of new features addresses the needs of your organization and improves the platform for everyone.</p>
