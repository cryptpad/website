        <p><img class="twenty left" src="images/doctorow.jpg" alt="Cory Doctorow's profile pic from Twitter"/>Tools like Etherpad and Google Docs are transformative ways to collaborate on text (including code); I've used them in contexts as varied as making unofficial transcripts of statements at UN agencies to liveblogging conference presentations — but they all share a weakness, which is that whomever owns the document server can see everything you're typing.</p>
        <p>CryptPad is a free/open project that uses some of the ideas behind blockchain to implement a "zero-knowledge" version of a collaborative document editor, ensuring that only the people working on a document can see it.</p>
