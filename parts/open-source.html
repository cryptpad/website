    <h2>Open-Source</h2>
    <p>We're not interested in monopoly or locking users into our platform, so we've made our complete platform <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad">fully open-source</a>! New releases are <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases">published</a> and deployed to <a href="https://cryptpad.fr">our flagship instance</a> at least once per month. Subscribing to <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/accounts/">a premium account</a> entitles you to priority support directly from the CryptPad team.</p>

    <p>For those that prefer to host the platform themseves, its code is provided <b>as-is, with no warranty</b>, as described in <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/blob/main/LICENSE">its license</a>. We offer a variety of premium options for our expert support and related services. All proceeds directly support the project's continued development.</p>

    <p>There are over {{instancecount}} third-party instances hosted in more than {{countries}} countries across six continents. A small number of these are administrated by organizations that want to help us provide platforms for those who aren't able to pay for privacy. We've curated <a href="instances.html">a list of public instances</a>.</p>
