    <h2>Sustainability</h2>
    <p>CryptPad is built without funding from ads or venture capital. You won't see any requests to disable your adblocker and we'll never sell your data to please investors. Our business model is based on that of our parent company, <a href="https://xwiki.com/">XWiki SAS</a>, which is 100% employee-owned and has been producing open-source collaboration software since 2004.</p>
    <p>Donations and subscriptions cover roughly one third of our costs. We pay for the remainder by participating in <a href="research.html">French and European research projects.</a>. This dependence on grants makes our roadmap subject to the high-level goals of our funding agencies.</p>
    <p>Since we can't predict which of our proposals will be funded we're unable to expand our team and spend more of our time on product design and development. Regular contributions from people like you get us closer to our goal of being financed entirely through our community.</p>
