    <h2>Governance</h2>
    <p>CryptPad is used at very different scales, by individuals, activists, small businesses, universities, and by users of our own commercial service. Everyone has different ideas about what the project should be. Our team of three full time developers balances the requirements of privacy and productivity across this wide range of contexts.</p>
    <p>We respond to <a href="https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad/issues">issues</a> and write detailed update notes in our <a href="https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> each release. We translate the platform and its documentation (including an <a href="https://docs.cryptpad.fr/en/admin_guide/index.html">up-to-date installation guide</a>) into <a href="https://docs.cryptpad.fr/en/">English</a> and <a href="https://docs.cryptpad.fr/fr/">French</a> and work with contributors to translate both into <a href="https://weblate.cryptpad.fr/projects/cryptpad/app/">a variety of other languages</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Regular donations to <a href="https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/contribute">our OpenCollective campaign</a> allow us to continue to dedicate time to these important tasks which  are otherwise very difficult to fund. Our <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/kanban/#/2/kanban/view/PLM0C3tFWvYhd+EPzXrbT+NxB76Z5DtZhAA5W5hG9wo/">roadmap</a> is driven by those that support us. If you are already an active financial contributor and would like your donation to be directed towards particular tasks then let us know! Otherwise, get involved and have your say!</p>
